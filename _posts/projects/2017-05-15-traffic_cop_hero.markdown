Traffic Cop Hero 1000 is a Galaga inspired shooter developed by Brendan Thompson, Griffin Cobb, and Kelsey McCoy for a Transylvania University month long May Term Game Design Class. During the course we learned the basics of game & story design, but all of the actual development was left up to the students. We decided to use Unity because it is free, easy to use, and there are plenty of good tutorials online.

- Created with Unity game Development Software
- Programmed Scripts in C#
- As a team developed the artwork, music, and gameplay
